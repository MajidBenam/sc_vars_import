Paris Basin,FrBeakr,-3200,-2301,U,We are aware of no discussion of this topic for the early phases of Bell Beaker culture,but a code of ABSENT would not be justified given the strong evidence for HS in other Old World cultures during the third millennium (see tables on Mesopotamia and Egypt during the First Dynasty) and the disagreement regarding HS in the subsequent Bell Beaker culture.,,,,,,,,,,
